*Summary: Scroll down for reproducible example which should run-from-scratch in Julia if you have the packages specified in the `using` lines. (Note: the ODE has a complex, re-usable structure which is specified in a Gist which is downloaded/`include`d by the script.)*

**Background:** I have to repeatedly solve a large system of ODEs for different initial conditions vectors.  In the example below, it is 127 states/ODEs, but it could easily be 1000-2000.  I will have to run these 100s-1000s of times for inference, so speed is essential.

**The Puzzle:** The short version is that, for the serial functions, the @simd version is much faster than the  "plain", non-`@simd` version.  But for the parallel versions, the `@simd` version is **much** slower -- plus, in this case, the answer, `sum_of_solutions`, is variable and wrong.

I have this set up so that Julia is started with `JULIA_NUM_THREADS=auto julia`, in my case this creates 8 cores for 8 threads.  Then, I make sure I never have more than 8 jobs spawned at once.

The different calculation times: (runtime, then sum_of_ODE_solutions)

```
# Output is (runtime, sum_of_solutions)
serial_with_plain_v7(tspan, p_Ds_v7, solve_results1; number_of_solves=number_of_solves)
serial_with_plain_v7(tspan, p_Ds_v7, solve_results1; number_of_solves=number_of_solves)
serial_with_plain_v7(tspan, p_Ds_v7, solve_results1; number_of_solves=number_of_solves)

# (0.366, 8.731365050398926)

parallel_with_simd_v7(tspan, p_Ds_v7, solve_results2; number_of_solves=number_of_solves)
# Dramatically slower than serial simd version, plus wrong sum_of_solutions
# (duration, sum_of_solutions)
# (136.966, 9.61313614002137)

```

As you can see, while serial `@simd` gets the calculation speed down to 0.046 seconds, and while parallel plain is 2.5 times faster than serial plain, when I combine parallelization with the `@simd` function I get runtimes of 140 seconds, and with variable & wrong answers to boot!  Literally the only difference between the two parallelizng functions is using `core_op_plain` versus `core_op_simd` for the core ODE solving operation.

It seems like `@simd` and `@spawn` must be conflicting somehow? I have the parallelizing function set up to never employ more than the number of CPU threads available. (8 on my machine.)

I am still learning Julia so there is the chance that some smallish change could isolate the `@simd` calculations and prevent conflicts across threads (if that is what is happening). Any help is very much appreciated! 

**PS: Reproducible Example.** The code below should provide a reproducible example on any Julia session running multiple cores. I also have my versioninfo() etc.:
