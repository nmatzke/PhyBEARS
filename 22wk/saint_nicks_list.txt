Saint Nick's list for what we want in PhyBEARS
(Ho ho ho!)

YES - 1. Text list of areas / ranges to: inputs.setup.states_list_txt

(add these to output table also)

YES, BUT - 2. Ancestral state calculation not just marginal likelihoods (downpass likelihoods)

3. Stochastic mapping

YES - 4. Node constraints (likelihood multipliers by node)

NO - 5. Export table to R, load in BioGeoBEARS, plot

xxx. distance between something and itself should be 0

6. invent bacronym for PhyBEARS

7. automatically extract lnLs & parameters to table

8. In BioGeoBEARS -- Biogeobears to SSE likelihood converter

9. Labels on output parameters

10. print arbitrary additions
# 
trait-dependent dispersal models
- with stochastic mapping

bS+SM stochastic + simulation

CONTACT PHD STUDENT WALLIS BLAND - 9. Linking Gplates distances
