Saint Nick's list for what we want in PhyBEARS
(Ho ho ho!)

1. Text list of areas / ranges

(add these to output table also)

2. Ancestral state calculation not just marginal likelihoods (downpass likelihoods)

3. Stochastic mapping

4. Node constraints (likelihood multipliers by node)

5. Export table to R, load in BioGeoBEARS, plot

xxx. distance between something and itself should be 0

6. invent bacronym for PhyBEARS

7. automatically extract lnLs & parameters to table

8. In BioGeoBEARS -- Biogeobears to SSE likelihood converter

9. Labels on output parameters

10. print arbitrary additions
# 
trait-dependent dispersal models
- with stochastic mapping

bS+SM stochastic + simulation

9. Linking Gplates distances
